											<ul>
												<li>Fairness of Terms and Conditions – We carefully read and evaluate each clause listed in each casino's T&Cs to uncover potentially unfair, misleading, or questionable rules. Such rules can potentially be used against players in a way we consider unfair, so the casino's Safety Index is lowered for each unfair clause.</li>
												<li>Casino size – We believe that bigger real money casinos are, in general, safer for players. This is because their size is a sign of quality and stability, allowing them to pay out big wins without running into financial difficulties. We have seen many cases of smaller casinos struggling to pay out players who managed to win big. This is why the known or estimated size of each casino is a factor contributing to its Safety Index.</li>
												<li>Player complaints – Complaints submitted to our Complaints Resolution Center or collected from other sources tell us a lot about how a casino treats its players, as well as what kinds of issues they face while playing. We thoroughly consider each complaint and decrease a casino's Safety Index for each justified complaint that has not been resolved by the casino. Complaints are considered in proportion with a casino's size, as bigger casinos are expected to receive more of them.</li>
												<li>Casino blacklists – There are several websites that publish a blacklist of online casinos, including our own CoinBets blacklist. If a casino appears on a blacklist, it can be an indicator of its negative qualities. We take a look at each listing and decrease the Safety Index of blacklisted casinos according to the reasoning behind it and our evaluation.</li>
