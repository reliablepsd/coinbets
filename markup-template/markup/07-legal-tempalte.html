								<h2 class="h1-entry">Terms of use of the CoinBets website</h2>
								<p><strong>These terms of use (the "Terms") provide for the mutual rights and obligations associated with the use of the Website used by the Users. We reserve the right to make any changes to these Terms without prior notice to the Users. Any change of the Terms will be posted on the Website and, where appropriate, notified to Users by e-mail.</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<h3 class="t-link">Definitions</h3>
										<ol>
											<li>
												<p>Capitalized terms used in these Terms have the following meaning: • Website means <a href="https://coinbet.com" target="_blank">https://coinbet.com</a> and its localised versions translated to other languages, which are available either at casino.guru subdomains or at separate domains. • Plural first-person pronouns like We, Us, or Our refer to the operator of the Website. • User means a natural or legal person accessing and using the Website. Users are also referred to by second-person pronouns like You or Your. • Privacy Protection Policy and Privacy Policy means a personal data and privacy protection policy of the Website, specified in section 6 of these Terms. • Data means all information that a User submits on the Website. • Cookie is a short text file placed on your computer by the Website or third parties when accessing the Website. • Data Protection Laws mean any applicable laws related to the processing of personal Data, including the Directive 95/46/EC or the GDPR, and any national implementing laws or regulations. • GDPR means General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679. • EU Cookie Law means directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 amended in 2006 and 2009. • The term User generated content refers to all written content, pictures, videos, and other forms of content posted to the Website by a User.</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Fairness of Terms and Conditions – We carefully read and evaluate each clause listed in each casino's T&amp;Cs to uncover potentially unfair, misleading, or questionable rules. Such rules can potentially be used against players in a way we consider unfair, so the casino's Safety Index is lowered for each unfair clause.</li>
													<li>Casino size – We believe that bigger real money casinos are, in general, safer for players. This is because their size is a sign of quality and stability, allowing them to pay out big wins without running into financial difficulties. We have seen many cases of smaller casinos struggling to pay out players who managed to win big. This is why the known or estimated size of each casino is a factor contributing to its Safety Index.</li>
													<li>Player complaints – Complaints submitted to our Complaints Resolution Center or collected from other sources tell us a lot about how a casino treats its players, as well as what kinds of issues they face while playing. We thoroughly consider each complaint and decrease a casino's Safety Index for each justified complaint that has not been resolved by the casino. Complaints are considered in proportion with a casino's size, as bigger casinos are expected to receive more of them.</li>
													<li>Casino blacklists – There are several websites that publish a blacklist of online casinos, including our own CoinBets blacklist. If a casino appears on a blacklist, it can be an indicator of its negative qualities. We take a look at each listing and decrease the Safety Index of blacklisted casinos according to the reasoning behind it and our evaluation.</li>
