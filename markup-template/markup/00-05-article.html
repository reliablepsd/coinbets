								<h2 class="t-link">Introduction to Provably Fair Gaming</h2>
								<p>If you're an online casino player, you have probably already encountered blockchain-based provably fair games and casinos at some point. But, because it's a relatively new field, you might not be familiar with exactly how they work. If that's the case, this original CoinBets.com guide is for you. We'll explain everything you need to know about provably fair games and casinos. We'll show you exactly how they work, what the advantages and potential disadvantages are, and recommend some top provably fair casino sites.</p>
								<h4>What is Provably Fair?</h4>
								<p>The term Provably Fair Gaming is most commonly used in the online gambling space. It refers to games that you, the player, can independently verify the fairness of. The games are based on blockchain technology and are largely trustless. This means that, unlike traditional online slots and other RNG (Random Number Generator) based games, you don't need to put your trust in the casino operator or their systems.</p>
								<p><strong>Why it Matters in Crypto Gambling</strong></p>
								<p>Fairness is, of course, important for online gambling in general. However, provably fair games are especially important in crypto gambling. This is primarily due to the nature of crypto casinos. Because most major regulators don't permit licensees to accept cryptocurrencies, they tend to be either licensed in Curaçao or somewhere even more obscure, like Anjouan (Comoros). And, while this doesn't necessarily mean they are dodgy, it does mean they aren't subject to the same rigorous third-party audits and oversight as casinos licensed in top-tier jurisdictions like the UK, Malta, or the various US states. Hence players at crypto casinos don't benefit from so much player protection and need to be able to independently establish if they can trust a site. Indeed, when it comes to true blockchain-based casinos, their decentralized nature makes regulatory oversight almost impossible. Likewise, the decentralized and pseudo-anonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies, while advantageous in many respects, means payments are final so players need to have complete faith in a platform before depositing. Offering provably fair games is an effective way of establishing this trust.</p>
								<h4>How Provably Fair Algorithms Work</h4>
								<p>So, you're probably wondering how provably fair games are, well, provably fair. Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you might think. Here's a quick guide to the nuts and bolts. </p>
								<h4>The Basics of Cryptographic Hash Functions</h4>
								<p>The Basics of Cryptographic Hash Functions Before we look at provably fair games, it's important to understand cryptographic hash functions in general. A cryptographic hash function will take some input data, like a number or word, and then convert it to a fixed-length string of characters called a hash. Each hash is unique - any change to the input will result in a different hash. You can think of a hash as a digital fingerprint for data.</p>
								<h4>Client and Server Seeds</h4>
								<p>Right, so let's say you're about to play a provably fair casino game. Before it starts, the game server will generate a random number, known as the server seed. The server seed will help predetermine the outcome of the subsequent game. The server seed is then run through a cryptographic hash function (for example, SHA-256), with the resulting hash then shared with the player. This hash cannot be changed and will act as part of the proof that the outcome of the game was predetermined and genuinely random.</p>
								<h4>Client and Server Seeds</h4>
								<p>In addition to the server seed, the player (either manually or automatically via their device) will also generate a seed before the game. This is known as the client or player seed. It is combined with the server seed to generate the exact outcome of the game. Because the final game result is predetermined by combining the two seeds, neither party can know the final result of the game beforehand.</p>
								<p>The nonce - If you see a reference to a 'nonce' regarding provably fair gaming, don't be alarmed, it's not that kind of nonce (Brits will understand!). Rather, it's a number, starting from 0 or 1, that changes with each bet to ensure rounds are unique. Think of it as a simple tally to keep track of rounds.</p>

								</figure>
								<h2 class="t-link">Verifying Results</h2>
								<p>To independently verify the resuls of a provabl fair game, you need to take several sie Verifying Results ed - Provic langed b to ensure he nonce</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The casino will provide you with a hash before the game begins (remember, this is the encoded server seed). Note it. </li>
									<li>Set the client seed, or note it down if it's automatically generated. </li>
									<li>Play the game as usual. </li>
									<li> After the game, the casino will provide the server seed used to generate the outcome. </li>
									<li>Take the server seed and run it through the same hash function the casino used. This can often be done directly on the casino platform itself (or using a third-party tool - we've linked one at the end of this article). </li>
									<li>Compare the hash generated with the original hash provided before the game. If nothing has been tampered with, both hashes should match exactly. </li>
									<li>Now you can use the server seed and client seed to rerun the game outcome using the algorithm provided by the casino. </li>
									<li>If the outcome of the game also matches what happened when you played it, you can rest assured everything was fair.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In short, note the hash before the game, then verify that the server seed matches the hash after the game, before recalculating the game outcome using both seeds. If everything matches up, then it's all fair.</p>
								<p>In short, note the hash before the game, then verify that the server seed matches the hash after the game, before recalculating the game outcome using both seeds. If everything matches up, then it's all fair.</p>

								<h2 class="t-link">Benefits of Provably Fair Casinos</h2>
								<p>The main benefit of provably fair games is that they allow players to have a much higher degree of confidence that a casino is playing fairly - even if the casino is not licensed in a tier-one jurisdiction or publicly audited by respected test labs.</p>
								<h4>Trust and Transparency</h4>
								<p>By using server and client seeds and cryptographic hash functions, provably fair games "lock in" predetermined results, while ensuring neither party has the information to see those results before the game has been played. However, the exact process of every round is completely transparent after it has been run, and can be re-run and checked. Any attempt to manipulate results will result in mismatched hashes and game outcomes. This essentially trustless system (as in, you don't need to put your trust in any entity) is in stark contrast to traditional RNG-based casino games, for which players have to put blind faith in casino operators, game suppliers, regulators, and test labs.</p>
								<h4>Player Confidence</h4>
								<p>In effect, provably fair games give you the chance to audit a casino yourself. While you probably won't want to go through the hassle of doing it after every game, you can do it whenever you want to. Casino operators offering provably fair games know they could be under the spotlight at any time, so have no incentive to try to manipulate results. Needless to say, this means players can have a high degree of confidence in provably fair games, and hence the casino offering them. In today's highly competitive online gambling ecosystem, this kind of confidence can be extremely valuable, leading to higher player retention, and thus lower spending on acquisition.</p>
								<h4>Popular Provably Fair Games</h4>
								<p>Any style of RNG-based game can be developed as a provably fair title. Here, we'll look at some of the most popular games on the market.</p>
								<h4>Examples of Provably Fair Games</h4>
								<h4>Slots</h4>
								<p>Slot games dominate most online casinos, with some sites offering thousands of titles. However, only a small fraction of those are currently provably fair. One of the first major iGaming software suppliers to launch a provably fair feature was BGaming, which integrated it with popular slot games including Aztec Magic Deluxe, Lucky Lady Clover, and Mysterious Story of Avalon: Lost Kingdom. These slots include a handy provably fair widget displaying all the seed and hash information a player needs to easily verify game results.</p>
								<h4>Crash Games</h4>
								<p>Perhaps the best-known provably fair crash game of recent years is Aviator from Ukrainian iGaming developer Spribe. A simple but thoroughly playable game, Aviator features a plane that takes off and follows an escalating multiplier curve - the longer it remains cruising on screen, the higher the winnings. But, it can fly away at any moment, and if you haven't already taken your winnings and bailed, you lose everything. Many other similar crash games have since been released, including Crash by BC Originals and Crash by Stake, plus NFT Aviatrix by Aviatrix.</p>
								<h4>Dice Games</h4>
								<p>Since Satoshi Dice, the world's first provably fair online casino game, launched in April 2012, the number of available titles has exploded (if you're interested, the SatoshiDice dApp is still available here). Today, virtually every major crypto casino has introduced provably fair dice games. Most provably fair dice games involve placing simple over/under bets, allowing players to double winnings.</p>
								<h4>Table Games </h4>
								<p>While the popularity of live dealer blackjack, roulette and baccarat was rapidly eclipsing their older RNG-based counterparts, the advent of provably fair gaming has given them a new lease of life. The nature of live games means players must trust the game operator - so the RNG-based provably fair games again have a unique selling point.</p>

								</figure>
								<h4 class="t-link">Comparison with Traditional Games</h4>
								<p>In terms of gameplay, playing provably fair crypto casino games is exactly the same as playing traditional format games. Whether it's slots, crash, dice, or table games, the user interface will be essentially the same. The only difference is that you will have seed and hash information provided - whether in a pop-up widget or integrated directly into the standard console. It's important to note that there's no obligation to go through any verification processes with provably fair games. You can play them as if they were any other and never check the results if you wish. Here at CoinBets.com, we recommend you focus on playing and enjoying a game, and just randomly conduct a check every now and then - don't develop OCD over it.</p>
								<h4>Challenges and Limitations</h4>
								<p>So, we've looked at the advantages of provably fair systems, but it's not all plain sailing - there are a few issues the online gaming industry still needs to better address. Complexity for New Users First and foremost among these issues is accessibility. As we've explained, provably fair systems aren't really all that complex, but they can certainly appear to be. This is especially true for players who aren't used to blockchain technology. Cryptographic hash functions and seeds can seem daunting even to people who have used popular cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Like most things in the crypto world and blockchain world, the problem of complexity is being gradually addressed. As more mainstream game developers start integrating the technology, user interfaces are becoming simpler and more player-friendly.</p>
								<h4>Trust in the Code</h4>
								<p>Although provably fair games reduce the need for players to trust casino operators, they still need to be able to trust the underlying technology. As always, all coding needs to be up to scratch. If there are bugs or hidden backdoors in the code, bad actors might be able to exploit them to manipulate outcomes. One of the best ways to keep things secure is by employing open-source transparency. Allowing a wide community of people with technical expertise to review code, flag possible problems, and suggest improvements, reduces the risk of manipulation going unnoticed. Also, the random number generator creating the server and client seeds needs to be genuinely random and unbiased. Even if the hashing and seeding processes were transparent, a dodgy RNG could still, in theory, generate results that weren't as random as they should be. This is what is important for provably fair game developers to use well-established, cryptographically secured RNG algorithms (here's an example of an RNG certification from iTech Labs - a respected iGaming industry auditor). Finally, another effective way to add extra security is to allow players to set or customize their seeds. This would make it much more difficult for a casino to manipulate an outcome.</p>

								<h4>What to Look for in a Provably Fair Casino</h4>
								<p><strong>With so many provably fair casinos out there, deciding where to play will, in large part, come down to personal taste. But, there are some things you can look for to ensure you enjoy great, hassle-free entertainment.</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>License.</strong> While most major gaming regulators refuse to license crypto casinos, the Curaçao Gaming Control Board will, and the jurisdiction has significantly improved in the past few years. The Kahnawake Gaming Commission will also license crypto casinos. Casinos with these licenses provide an extra layer of player protection. </li>
									<li><strong>Games and providers.</strong> Check if the casino has the types of games you like. Even at the best crypto casino, the number of provably fair games will still be relatively small, so make sure there's enough else to keep you happy. Look for reputable providers like NetEnt, Evolution, NoLimit City, Play'n Go, Microgaming, and Pragmatic Play. </li>
									<li><strong>Provably fair resources.</strong> The best provably fair casinos will make it easy to find their provably fair games, and easy to find information like seeds and hashes and verify rounds. For example, BC.Game has a dedicated 'Provably Fair' page accessible from the main menu. This provides easy access to the verification information and tools. </li>
									<li><strong>Banking options.</strong> If you're interested in blockchain-based provably fair games, you will probably want to deposit and withdraw with crypto. Make sure the casino accepts a good range of popular cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, and Bitcoin Cash. If it accepts a wider range of Altcoins, like Dogecoin, Solana, Cardana, and even privacy coins like Monero, then even better. Of course, it's nice to have fiat options like Visa and Mastercard too.</li>
									<li><strong>Bonuses.</strong> Okay, most casinos have bonuses that look great at first glance but always read the terms and conditions. First up, the terms should be easy to find and read. Secondly, they should be fair. Pay particular attention to things like wagering requirements, maximum wins/cashouts, time limits, and game restrictions. </li>
									<li><strong>Reviews. </strong>It's always a good idea to do your homework before depositing at any online casino. And we don't just mean reading stuff here at CoinBets.com. Check out other popular crypto casino review sites. Never put too much weight on a single review though - remember, many will be trying to sell you something, and others will be from bitter losers and rival casinos. Try and get a general big-picture feel for the reputation of a casino.</li>

								<h4>The Future of Provably Fair Gaming</h4>
								<p>Although blockchain-based provably fair games and crypto casinos have now been around for more than a decade, it's important to put things in perspective. Most new technologies are around for quite a long time before going mainstream. Consider that series-produced cars were available to buy in the late 1890s, but it wasn't until the 1920s and 30s that they became commonplace in America, and even later than that elsewhere. Likewise, the early form of the internet was available in the 1980s, but it wasn't until the start of the 21st century that most households went online. We are seeing a similar phenomenon with blockchain and crypto technology. Bitcoin may have been launched way back in 2009, but for most of the population, blockchain technology is still a new thing. So, we're only really in the early stages of the blockchain revolution. Trends in Blockchain and Fairness One of the driving forces in this ongoing blockchain revolution is Web3. The transition from the centralized Web2 to the decentralized Web3 is evident in the proliferation of dApps - a process now being expedited by the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). From convenient browser- based crypto wallets like MetaMask, to the expanding range of decentralized finance (DeF1) services, and the continued adoption of tokenization in video games, decentralization is gathering pace. All of this is built around the concept of trustlessness - using smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum, BSC, and Avalanche to remove the need to trust intermediaries. And, the innovation is largely driven by open-source development, centered around stakeholder communities. These fundamental forces ensure that fairness and transparency will only become more enshrined as core values, leading to even more robust foundations for provably fair games.</p>

								<h4 class="t-link">Increasing Adoption </h4>
								<p>It seems inevitable that all casinos will eventually offer provably fair games to remain competitive. Crypto casinos like Stake and BC.Game have already proven there's a massive public demand for provably fair games. They have also proven that by embracing provably fair technology, they can increase customer retention, and hence improve their profitability. And, with mainstream game providers integrating provably fair blockchain technology into their offerings, it is becoming cheaper and easier for existing casino operators to upgrade. </p>
								<p>However, real mass adoption of provably fair games will come when the big gaming regulators, like the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), and authorities in Sweden, New Jersey, and Ontario, etc., finally allow their licensees to accept cryptocurrencies. Because, while nothing is stopping traditional fiat-only online casinos from offering provably fair games, most don't because their player base simply doesn't understand blockchain. As things stand, those comfortable with handling seeds and verifying hashes are very much crypto fans - and they play at offshore crypto casinos. </p>
								<p>But, when that dam breaks and crypto gaming can finally go mainstream in the big gambling jurisdictions, then operators will probably be incentivised to introduce the masses to provably fair gaming. This will also further encourage investment in refining the user experience, making it even more popular.</p>
								<h4>Conclusion and Resources</h4>
								<p><strong>Why Choose Provably Fair Casinos </strong></p>
								<p>As you've read, provably fair games and casinos offer a tantalizing glimpse of the future of online gambling in the decentralized world of Web3. In essence, you should consider playing at provably fair casinos because it empowers you, the player, by giving you the full picture. They can provide much more peace of mind than traditional casino games.</p>
								<p>Just keep in mind that, as with all technologies, blockchain and provably fair systems are constantly evolving. Nothing is foolproof, and there are risks. You should still exercise caution and research before depositing funds at any online casino.</p>
